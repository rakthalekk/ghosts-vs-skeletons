kills the most humans wins

Here are some Tips to have more Kills than your opponent:
--- There are several power ups that boosts your stats, so make sure to collect them when you can
--- You can use Statues around the map to change its layout to inconvience the other player
--- To fall through transparent platforms as the Skeleton, press the S button
--- The \"Special\" Action can only be performed by obtaining a certain power-up and is not regularly avaliable
--- The Skeleton's Attack is a projectile while the Ghost must be in a close enough range"
